\section{Conclusions}
The following can be stated about the results of this project:
\begin{itemize}
\item The component of our classification process that had the strongest effect on was data preprocessing, which actually had a \textit{negative} effect on classifier performance, increasing the error rate by 10\%.
\item The negative effect on preprocessing might be due to lost information about capitalization, punctuation, and verb conjugation.
\item On both the clean and the dirty datasets, the KNN classifier nominally outperformed the Bayes classifier.
\item For the KNN classifiers, high K values performed best on the ``clean'' dataset and low K values performed best on the ``dirty dataset.
\end{itemize}
