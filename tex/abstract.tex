The quality of the comments made on Online shopping has always suffered due to anonymity of it’s users. When users comments on, for instance, a Router, there is no repercussion for what they say, and the dialog generated is often not helpful. Different websites have tried different methods for determine comments are helpful or not. Quora rank a community that values high quality responses over low quality ones, Reddit uses an vote system, and Amazon allows for its users to to rate the “helpfulness” of reviews left on their products. Amazon’s system, more specifically, allows for the higher rated comments to be displayed at the top of the review forum so that new users can see the top rated comments in order to help them make their own purchasing decisions.
In our Project, we use the public Amazon product review data from UCSD as our dataset to evaluate different model performance. We try seven different training models and get the classification results.
