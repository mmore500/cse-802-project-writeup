\section{Data}

Our dataset is a labeled subset of Amazon review data made available by Julian McAuley at \url{http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/} \cite{he2016ups, mcauley2015image}.
The unlabeled dataset includes reviews for products across a variety of 24 Amazon departments including Books, Electronics, Movies and TV, CDs and Vinyl, Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry, Home and Kitchen, Kindle Store, etc.
The unlabeled dataset includes the fields:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{reviewerID}, a unique identifying string that identifies the user who left a review
\item \texttt{asin}, a unique identifier for the product being reviewed;
\item \texttt{reviewerName}, the username of the reviewer;
\item \texttt{helpful}, a two-element tuple describing the number of users who marked the review ``helpful'' and the number of users who marked the review as ``not helpful;''
\item \texttt{reviewText}, the text of the review;
\item \texttt{overall}, the rating out of five stars provided by the reviewer;
\item \texttt{summary}, the title of the review;
\item \texttt{unixReviewTime} and \texttt{reviewTime}, timestamps of the review.
\end{itemize}


In addition, Julian McAuley provides metadata that describes characteristics of products being reviewed including text description, price, sales-rank, brand info, and co-purchasing links (i.e. related products that customers bought, related products that customers viewed).

Our labeled subset contains 1991 reviews drawn from the electronics department.
In addition to the fields provided above, reviews in our labeled subset include the binary label \texttt{helpful}/\texttt{not helpful}.
This label was assigned manually by Jie and collaborators based on whether the review contained relevant, specific information describing the product and its performance (i.e. providing specific reasons \textit{why} they assigned it a particular overall review.
Our labeled dataset is formatted as a single, tidy JSON file, so working with the dataset in modern data analysis frameworks (e.g. pandas) was be straightforward.
