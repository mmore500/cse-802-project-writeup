\section{Problem Statement}
The problem we aim to solve is helpfulness of online reviews.
We want to automatically classify reviews as either helpful or not helpful.
We define helpful to mean well-written, detailed, and on topic.
This way, unhelpful reviews can be hidden so shoppers are only shown helpful reviews. 
In doing this, we would ease the struggles of online shopping, and help businesses such as amazon have improved customer satisfaction as well as other possible effect such as increased customers or sales.
