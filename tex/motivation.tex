\section{Motivation}
The motivation for this project came from wanting to better understand the algorithms used by online shopping sites and what sort of patterns were observed from the reviews that were being displayed when one looks at a particular product. For example, a top review for a router is as follow:\\

”I could not get this product to connect to my laptop and called costumer support. They did not answer so I returned it.”\\

This review, though at the top of the reviews, is difficult to understand and barely provide helpful information for a product. The problem being addressed in this project is the poor quality of Amazon reviews at the top of the forum despite the helpfulness rating system. To resolve this problem will be use existing data as training data to build models to determining new incoming review is relevant or irrelevant.
