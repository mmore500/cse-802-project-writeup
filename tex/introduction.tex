\section{Introduction}
Online shopping has become more and more popular as computers have become a more common household item. Sites such as Amazon, eBay, and the like have grown over  the last decade as the ease of shopping online has grown due to next day delivery, searching for specific products, and most of all selling used products to others. With this new market a common question arises: how can we know that the items we are ordering are indeed what they are hoping to be? Without being able to hold or sometimes even see the item, it is hard to know what one might be getting when ordering an item from an unknown seller that could be thousands of miles away. The answer to this question is online reviews.

Leaving reviewers for certain products or even about certain sellers has become common place in online shopping. Smart shoppers do a lot of research before hitting that checkout button, and our goal for this project to determine if their time is well spent pouring through the reviews they see online. We plan have a sample of reviews that were left for certain products online. By creating a classification method, we want to determine the importance of each review left. An example might be someone leaving a one star review, and their only comment being "did not enjoy." This type of comment adds no further knowledge to the buyer, and would therefore be a waste to take into account when seeing the average star review for a product.
